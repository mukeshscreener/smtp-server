## Overall Checklist
- [ ] Choose a host which provides reverse DNS and whitelisted IPs: [choosing host](./choosing-host.md)
- [ ] Start a new virtual server: use FQDN (eg `mail.domain.com`) as hostname.
- [ ]  Assign Elastic IP as they are negotiated for whitelisting.
- [ ]  Check Server IP Quality on spam tracking services: [IP status](./ip-status.md)

- [ ] Open a support ticket with your host to allow SMTP.
- [ ] Enable firewall: [server setup](./server-setup.md)
- [ ] Install postfix on server: [installing postfix](./setting-up-postfix.md)
- [ ] Send a test mail from SMTP server
- [ ] Send a test mail from another machine using authentication

- [ ] Fine tune installation
- [ ] Setup SPF DNS record
- [ ] Setup DKIM DNS record
- [ ] Setup PTR record (reverse DNS): done at [host level](http://joshua5201.github.io/blog/2015/06/06/setting-up-reverse-dns-ptr-record-in-digitalocean/): check status [here](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=ptr%3a159.65.157.119&run=toolpage#)
    - [ ]  [Floating IP on DigitalOcean does not support PTR](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-do-i-set-the-ptr-for-a-floating-ip).
- [ ]  Send a test mail to see results: `echo "Testing" | mail -aReply-To:your.email@gmail.com -s "Testing Mail" check-auth@verifier.port25.com`

- [ ]  Setup [Google Postmaster account](https://postmaster.google.com/u/0/dashboards#do=screener.in&st=domainReputation&dr=7) to debug mail quality
- [ ]  Setup [Outlook SNDS (smart network data service)](https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/index.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0)
